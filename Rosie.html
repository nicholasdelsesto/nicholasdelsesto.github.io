When I was in 2nd grade I was outside helping my dad paint the outside of our house. I saw a quick shuffle in the bushes near our house and think it's our neighbors outside cat. As we continue to paint, I was able to get a closer look and find out it's a scrawny tiny little dog. We give her some food and take her to the pound.
Knowing my sister and I wanted to keep her, my parents compromised with us that she would spend ten nights in the pound to see if her previous owner picks her up and if not then we can adopt her. Luckily for us, the previous owners did not show.  
She's very mean to other dogs but is very nice to humans and cats. Rosie was estimated to be two when we first got her and she's about 16 as of now. Although she has had a long healthy life, she has her fair share of issues now. She has kidney issues and requires special food, she is nearly deaf and can only hear the loudest of sounds and she doesn't have the strongest eyesight anymore.
We are blessed to have had the opportunity to adopt her and she's been my best friend ever since.
