<h2>About Me</h2>
<P>I am a 20 year old sports lover who was born in Balston Spa, New York. Although I was born in New York I only lived there for about four years and subsequently moved to Cranston, Rhode Island.
I've grown up in Cranston and consider it my home. I've lived in Cranston, close to my parents family, for fifteen years and then moved to Narragansett, Rhode Island. We've just moved to 
Narragansett in this previous February and are right on the coast next to the beach. 
</P>
<P> At the moment I am working at Wild Birds Unlimited in Warwick, Rhode Island, which my father owns. He purchased the store my sophomore year of high school and has turned it into a highly succesful business.
Hopefully next semester I will be able to get a job on campus through work study to make some side money.
